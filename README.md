# SPIFF

Spiff is the Simple Parser for Interesting File Formats

## Building

Spiff uses Maven as its build tool. I know, I'm not overjoyed either, but it's the path of least resistance.

The GNU Java Expressions Library (JEL) is not available in public maven repositories, you should [install](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html)
it into your local maven repository before running the maven build.
