# SPIFF

Spiff is the Simple Parser for Interesting File Formats.  You can include SPIFF in your own projects by adding the [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#revbingo/SPIFF/0.3.0) repository to your build file

## Building

Spiff uses Maven as its build tool. I know, I'm not overjoyed either, but it's the path of least resistance.

## License

Spiff is released under an [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).
